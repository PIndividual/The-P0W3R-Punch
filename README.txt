Please only look at the sketch.js file. 
Other files with the suffix bak are previous versions, 
which are used to roll back the code when a serious failure occurs. 
If you still want to look at these versions, just delete their suffixes.

There is also a link to the p5 online editor if this version won't work correctly.
