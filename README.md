# The-P0W3R-Punch

a p5js interactive animation.

Inspired by anime: the protagonist charges up and then unleashes a shocking attack!

Hold LMB to charge, release to fire! (the longer you hold, the bigger the shockwave is 🤪)

---

To preview the effect, use `Visual Studio Code` to open the entire root folder, then enable the `live server` plugin. (You can get it from the VS Code extensions)

To modify the code, go to `sketch.js`

---

Still trying to figure out how to run the code natively by launching the `index.html`. 😅
